# TCGA Survival Analysis

This Python script demonstrates the use of the isb-cgc database to perform survival analysis on TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data for a specified gene and cancer type and how to fetch the data using Google BigQuery. This is purely for illustration.

## Setup

1. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Set up Google Cloud credentials and save the path in a `.env` file
3. Modify the `gene` and `disease` variables as needed

## Usage

Run the script to generate a survival plot for the specified gene and cancer type, demonstrating the use of isb-cgc database and Google BigQuery for TCGA data analysis.
